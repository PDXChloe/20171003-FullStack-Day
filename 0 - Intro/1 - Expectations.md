# Course Expectations

Although it might seem overbearing on the first day, we want to make sure you completely understand all of the requirements you will be held to in order to pass.

This is a pass / no pass course, there are no grades. Whether or not you pass depends on your ability to attend class and complete the assignments and capstone within the weeks allotted.  The capstone is a large comprehensive project where you will demonstrate all of the skills learned.

## Attendance

Arriving more than 15 minutes after class starts counts as a 'late', 3 lates count as an absence.

To graduate you can only miss at most 10% of the classes. The only exceptions are up to five days of excused absence already arranged before the course starts.

You can quickly fall behind if you miss several classes in succession. The course moves fast, and each topic builds upon the last. You can make up classes by coming in additional hours outside of class, but I have to work within the limitations of my own schedule. You can also make up absences by completing the assignments on your own, and reviewing those solutions with me.

## Assignments

This is not a high school or community college class. There is minimal lecture. There is a focus on practicality and delivering results, not studying concepts. This is an immersive, hands-on educational experience that mimics and prepares you for the on-the-job learning you will have to do _continually_ as a professional software developer. Most of the class time will be allotted to working on assignments individually.

All submitted work must be your own. You are encouraged to use resources (docs, online, books, each other) to research solutions.

Make an honest attempt before you ask for help. Look carefully at the error message and where in the code it's occurring. Look through the provided resources, look at previous labs, do a bit of online research (exercise your google-fu).

If you're stuck after 12 minutes of review and research, please ask for help. Your fellow students and I are always here for feedback.

Many assignments will have an 'advanced' section, which are additional features you can complete if you have the time or the desire, and may require you to do additional research. Do not work on them until you are done with the basic version of the assignment. Advanced requirements will enable you to reach into the more advanced topics of the course, and will result in a deeper understanding of the language.

Don't consider an assignment 'finished' until it's been thoroughly tested. Try many different inputs and verify the output. Check for 'edge' cases or unexpected user input.

I'll review your solutions from time to time and verify that they successfully fit the requirements of the assignment. If they don't, you'll need to fix them.

Occasionally we'll do pair programming for a lab. This means you and a partner will collaborate on a single lab. Ensure that neither of you is in control of the keyboard for the majority of the time. Alternate roles between directing (talking about what needs to be done) and driving (actually typing).

We'll also occasionally do code reviews, where someone presents their program to the class and walks us through how each part works.

Outside-of-class tutoring is free and can be scheduled with the instructional staff.


## Progress Updates

I will be emailing you written progress updates at the 25%, 50%, and 75% dates throughout the course.
You'll also get a progress report upon graduation.
They'll contain a summary of:

* How I think you're progressing in the course.
* Topics I think you should focus on.
* Your attendance record.
* Any course requirements you are not satisfying or are close to not satisfying.


## How to succeed in this course

- Be self-motivated, independent, open to learning. Learning is itself a skill that can be learned.

- Many people experience a 'mental block' when faced with technical jargon and confusing syntax. Focus on overcoming that apprehension, get yourself in a learning mentality. The software landscape is constantly changing, you'll need to be learning new languages and frameworks throughout your career. Assume a learning mentality now, and it'll help you throughout your career.

- Cultivate an attention to detail. Computers are unforgiving. They have a very small set of low-level operations and require you to use them precisely.

- Practice critical thinking, breaking down complex problems into more manageable chunks. These determine the high-level structure of a program, and come from your ability to understand a problem rather than the details of the language or framework.

- Nobody is perfect, especially when you're starting something new. Focus more on learning from your mistakes than internalizing the idea you're not "meant" to be a programmer.

- Always attend class, always be engaged while you're here.

- Ask questions. If I don't understand where you're at in your abilities and understanding, I can't offer tailor-made advice. Questions may also may clarify ideas for others. Ask eachother questions. Teaching is the best way to solidify your own understanding.

- Spend some time reviewing and studying outside of class, particularly over the weekend.
